## Rules for game (integrate into UI)

1. Starting Position: Each player begins the game with 12 pieces positioned on the three closest rows to their side of the board.
2. Movement Rules: Pieces must move diagonally and are restricted to the Light squares of the checkerboard.
3. Basic Movement: Regular pieces can move forward one square diagonally unless executing a capturing move.
4. Non-capturing Moves: A regular move involves shifting a piece one square diagonally to an adjacent unoccupied dark square.
5. Capturing Moves: To capture an opponent's piece, a playerâ€™s piece jumps over that piece in a straight diagonal line and lands on the next dark square, which must be vacant.
6. Single Capture Rule: Only one piece may be captured in a single jump; however, multiple jumps are permissible within the same turn if consecutive captures are possible.
7. Single Capture Rule: Only one piece may be captured in a single jump; however, multiple jumps are permissible within the same turn if consecutive captures are possible.
8. King Promotion: When a piece reaches the furthest row from the player controlling that piece, it becomes a king. Kings are distinguished from other pieces by being stacked or marked.
9. King Movement: Kings have the ability to move both forward and backward diagonally.
